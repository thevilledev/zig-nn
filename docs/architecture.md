# Neural Network Architecture

This document outlines the architectural design of our neural network implementation in Zig.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Memory Safety**: Utilizing Zig's memory safety features and explicit allocation
2. **Performance**: Optimized matrix operations and efficient memory usage
3. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between components
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new layer types and activation functions

## Component Overview

### Matrix Operations (`matrix.zig`)
- Core mathematical operations
- Memory-efficient implementation
- Support for batch operations
- Optimized for neural network computations

### Layers (`layer.zig`)
Two main layer types:
1. **Standard Layer**
   - Traditional fully connected layer
   - Configurable activation functions
   - Weight and bias management
   
2. **Gated Layer**
   - Support for GLU and SwiGLU
   - Dual weight matrices
   - Optimized gating operations

### Network (`network.zig`)
- Flexible layer composition
- Dynamic architecture building
- Support for different loss functions:
  - Mean Squared Error
  - Cross Entropy
- Mini-batch training capabilities

## Memory Management

### Allocation Strategy
- Clear ownership model
- Explicit deallocation
- Efficient matrix reuse
- Temporary buffer management

### Resource Lifecycle
1. Network initialization
2. Layer allocation
3. Forward propagation buffers
4. Backward propagation gradients
5. Clean deallocation

## Error Handling

Using Zig's error union types for handling:
- Invalid dimensions
- Memory allocation failures
- Numerical instabilities
- Configuration errors

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Matrix Operations**
   - Cache-friendly memory layout
   - Vectorized operations where possible
   - Minimal temporary allocations

2. **Training Process**
   - Efficient mini-batch processing
   - Smart gradient accumulation
   - Memory reuse between iterations

3. **Memory Layout**
   - Contiguous memory for matrices
   - Aligned allocations
   - Efficient striding

## Future Considerations

Areas for potential improvement:
1. SIMD optimizations
2. GPU acceleration
3. Distributed training support
4. Additional layer types:
   - Convolutional layers
   - Attention mechanisms
   - Residual connections
