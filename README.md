# Neural Network in Zig

[![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Work%20in%20Progress-yellow)](https://github.com/thevilledev/zig-nn)

A minimalistic neural network implementation in Zig for learning purposes. This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of neural networks including hidden layers, activation functions, and basic training processes.

## Features

- Matrix operations from scratch
- Common activation functions (Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh)
- Basic feed-forward neural network architecture

## Building

Make sure you have Zig installed on your system. This project is developed with the latest stable version of Zig.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thevilledev/zig-nn.git
cd zig-nn

# Build the project
zig build

# Run tests
zig build test
```

## Learning Goals

This project serves as a learning exercise for:

- Understanding neural network fundamentals
- Implementing mathematical operations in Zig
- Working with Zig's memory management and error handling
